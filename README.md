# Codsoft internship
I successfully completed a Java development internship at Codsoft intern. During this 4 weeks internship, I worked on three projects:  Student Grade Calculator, Number Guessing Game, and Quiz Game with Timer.

1. Student Grade Calculator:
   - I made a tool that helps figure out student grades. It takes in the grades you put in and tells you useful stuff like the average grade, highest and lowest scores, and how well everyone did overall.
   - I got better at making things easy to use and solving problems while working on this.

2. Number Guessing Game:
   - I created a fun game where you have to guess a number. The computer picks a random number, and you try to guess it. 
   - This project improved my skills in making games and understanding how to make them enjoyable.

3. Quiz Game with Timer:
   - I made a game that asks you questions, and you have to answer them against the clock. The faster and more accurate you are, the better your score.
   - This project challenged me to handle time in a game and taught me how to manage questions and answers in a smart way.

 I'm grateful for this experience, and I'm excited to use the skills I've gained in my future career as a Java developer.
